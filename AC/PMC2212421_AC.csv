relatively low uptake of apoptotic cell .,4,,,,addition of serum to the phagocytosis assay increase the uptake of apoptotic cell by more than threefold .,5,,,,the serum factor responsible for enhance uptake be identify as complement component that require activation of both the classical pathway and alternative pathway amplification loop .,6,,,,exposure of phosphatidylserine on the apoptotic cell surface be partially responsible for complement activation and result in coating the apoptotic cell surface with c3bus .,7,,,,"in the presence of serum , the macrophage receptor for c3bus , cr3 ( cd11b and cd18 ) and cr4 ( cd11c and cd18 ) , be significantly more efficient in the uptake of apoptotic cell compare with previously describe receptor implicate in clearance .",8,,,,"complement activation be likely to be require for efficient uptake of apoptotic cell within the systemic circulation , and early component deficiency could predispose to systemic autoimmunity by enhance exposure to and and or aberrant deposition of apoptotic cell .",9,,,,"although the apoptotic cell death program be execute in hour , the removal of die cell be normally so rapid that few cell be see -- even in tissue such as the thymus , where up to 95 % of cell undergo apoptosis .",10,,,,"the importance , and complexity , of phagocytosis be highlight by genetic study of apoptosis in the nematode , caenorhabditis elegan .",11,,,,"of the 14 gene ( ced 1-14 ) that regulate apoptosis during development of C. elegan , at least 6 encode protein that be require for engulfment of apoptotic cell .",12,,,,a important stage of apoptosis involve the acquisition of surface change on the apoptotic cell lead to rapid recognition and phagocytosis by surround cell follow by degradation in lysosome .,13,,,,"the mechanism whereby apoptotic cell be efficiently identify , remove , and degrade by phagocyte in mammalian cell be not well understand .",14,,,,several ligand and receptor have be report to play a role in the initial engulfment of apoptotic cell in vitro .,15,,,,"these include known receptor such as the alphavbeta3 integrin , cd36 , which share the alphavbeta3 and cd36 / thrombospondin recognition mechanism , other class a and b scavenger receptor ( - ) , the atp binding cassette transporter abc1 , and cd14 , as well as unknown receptor that have be characterize by they lectin binding property or by specific recognition of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) 1 .",16,,,,"in human peripheral blood derive macrophage , the known receptor show a relatively low uptake of apoptotic cell ( average of 40 apoptotic cell per 100 macrophage [ 12 , 13 ] ) and be only partially inhibit by specific block agent in vitro .",17,,,,"significantly , phagocytic assay of human monocyte derive macrophage have be perform in the absence of serum ( , , - ) .",18,,,,we report that a serum factor ( s ) provide a more than threefold increase in the uptake of apoptotic cell by human macrophage and demonstrate that complement component be require for this high level of uptake .,19,,,,result,20,,,,the effect of serum on Uptake of apoptotic cell by human macrophage .,21,,,,"to determine the effect of serum factor on the efficiency of phagocytosis of apoptotic cell , the pi be compare between macrophage expose to apoptotic cell in the presence ( nh ) or absence ( no ) of normal human serum as well as in the presence of heat inactivate serum ( he ) .",22,,,,"since condition have be establish for reliable induction of apoptosis of murine thymocyte with minimal necrosis ( < 5 % and 2 % uptake of propidium iodide and trypan blue , respectively [ 16 ] ) , initial experiment be perform with murine thymocyte .",23,,,,as show in fig .,24,,,,", a and b , heat-labile serum factor ( s ) induce at least a 10-fold increase in the pi that be dependent on time , temperature , and serum concentration .",25,,,,"in the presence of 15 % serum , at least 5 apoptotic cell be engulf by most macrophage as show in fig .",26,,,,"c , whereas 0-1 cell be macrophage associate in the absence of serum .",27,,,,similar result be observe when apoptosis be induce by dexamethasone ( result not show ) .,28,,,,"the experiment be then repeat in a entirely autologous system , i.e. , use serum and macrophage as well as apoptotic neutrophil or t cell from the same donor .",29,,,,"in the absence of serum , the pi be 37 + /- 19 , similar to previous report , but be 156 + /- 28 in the presence of serum ( representative example be show in fig .",30,,,,", e-g ) .",31,,,,"to distinguish between the requirement for serum factor ( s ) for opsonization ( see below ) versus uptake of apoptotic cell , apoptotic lymphocyte be incubate either with 15 % autologous serum or medium without serum for 1 h at 37degreesc and the phagocytosis assay be perform in the absence of serum ( two step assay ) .",32,,,,"in the absence of serum at both step , the baseline pi be 25 + /- 14 compare with 81 + /- 19 when apoptotic lymphocyte have be expose to serum but the phagocytosis assay perform in the absence of serum .",33,,,,these finding indicate that serum factor ( s ) be more important for opsonization of the apoptotic cell than at the stage of phagocytosis .,34,,,,Complement Components be require for efficient uptake of apoptotic cell by human macrophage .,35,,,,the marked enhancement of the pi induce by a serum factor that be abrogate by heat to 56degreesc for 30 min suggest that complement component could be responsible for the uptake of apoptotic cell .,36,,,,"to determine whether protein of the classical and and or alternative complement pathway be require for phagocytosis of apoptotic cell , we evaluate the pi in the presence of serum deplete of specific complement component .",37,,,,"when apoptotic neutrophil or t lymphocyte be use as target , normal or c9 deficient serum augment the pi three- to fivefold .",38,,,,"in contrast , serum deplete of factor b , c1q , or c3 ( not show ) have a pi only slightly greater than the no control .",39,,,,"to verify the specificity of these observation , we perform add-back experiment with the purified complement component c1q , factor b , c3 , and c9 .",40,,,,as show in fig .,41,,,,", when the appropriate complement component be add to the c1q-_NN or factor b deficient serum , the pi return to the value observe in the presence of 15 % serum .",42,,,,addition of c1q in the absence of serum do not restore the pi ( datum not show ) .,43,,,,"similar result be obtain when murine thymocyte , jurkat t cell , or bl-41 b cell be use as apoptotic target in these experiment ( not show ) .",44,,,,PS exposure activate Complement .,45,,,,"to further investigate the mechanism responsible for complement activation , we examine whether the major c3 breakdown product , c3bus , be deposit on the surface of apoptotic neutrophil or lymphocyte by flow cytometry .",46,,,,as show in fig .,47,,,,", apoptotic lymphocyte ( b ) and neutrophil ( e , top right ) but not nonapoptotic lymphocyte ( a ) or neutrophil ( d , bottom leave ) stain positively for c3bus .",48,,,,"two-color flow cytometry reveal that 31 % of the neutrophil be in the early apoptotic stage ( annexin v positive , pi negative [ not show ] ; top and bottom right [ 17 ] ) and that c3bus coated 61 % of the apoptotic cell and > 90 % of the annexin vhigh apoptotic population .",49,,,,PS have be show to serve as a specific ligand for recognition of apoptotic cell .,50,,,,"recognition of PS be particularly relevant to the engulfment of apoptotic cell , since PS be a acidic phospholipid that normally reside on the inside of the cell , but translocate to the outside of the cell membrane when the cell undergo apoptosis .",51,,,,"to determine whether block PS exposure on the apoptotic cell would inhibit complement activation , we preincubate apoptotic cell with annexin v , expose the cell to serum , and then quantify c3bus exposure by flow cytometry .",52,,,,as show in fig .,53,,,,", c and d , annexin v substantially reduce , but do not completely inhibit , c3bus deposition .",54,,,,these finding strongly suggest that PS on the surface of apoptotic cell be at least partially responsible for complement activation .,55,,,,complement receptor be require for efficient uptake of Opsonized apoptotic cell .,56,"human, monocytes, macrophages","S1,C1,C2",,"human monocyte and macrophage express three known receptor , cr1 , cr3 , and cr4 , that bind complement protein or they degradation product .",57,,E1-E5,"S1,C1,C2","cr1 ( cd35 ) bind mainly c3b , c4b , and c1q , whereas cr3 ( cd11b and cd18 ) and cr4 ( cd11c / cd18 ) be relatively specific for c3bus .",58,,,,"since apoptotic cell be coat with c3bus , we perform block experiment with mab specific to the complement receptor in order to evaluate they role in ligand binding .",59,,,,as show in fig .,60,,,,", mab to cr3 , cr4 , and cr1 inhibit uptake of apoptotic neutrophil by 60 + /- 8 , 50 + /- 4 , and 11 + /- 7 % , respectively .",61,,,,"since most prior study of receptor and ligand implicate in engulfment of mammalian apoptotic cell be perform in the absence of serum ( , , - ) , we evaluate they role in the presence of serum use mab or ligand to inhibit they binding .",62,,,,as show in fig .,63,,,,"a , all three receptor be highly express on the surface of human monocyte derive macrophage .",64,,,,"only rgd ( which be think not to inhibit cd11 and cd18 [ 22 ] ) significantly inhibit uptake of apoptotic cell under these condition , although specific inhibition ( inhibition by rgds-rge ) be only 16 % .",65,,,,"to definitively test the role of cr3 in the recognition of apoptotic cell , we examine the ability of a chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cell line stably transfect with cr3 to phagocytose apoptotic cell .",66,,,,as show in fig .,67,,,,"c , the pi of nontransfected cho cell be near baseline in the presence or absence of serum , whereas the cr3 transfect cell line cho-r3 have a pi approximating that observe in human macrophage in the presence of serum and show extensive rosetting .",68,,,,discussion,69,,,,"these study demonstrate for the first time that both the classical and alternative pathway of complement be activate by apoptotic cell in isologous condition lead to deposition of c3bus on the apoptotic cell surface , that PS be at least partially involve in this activation , and that recognition of ligand by the macrophage complement receptor cr3 and cr4 be the most efficient mechanism of uptake of apoptotic cell in the presence of serum .",70,,,,"since c1q have be report to bind to apoptotic cell , the result of we study suggest that apoptotic cell activate the classical pathway but that amplification via the alternative pathway loop be require for efficient recognition by macrophage .",71,,,,"the requirement for both classical and alternative complement pathway activation for efficient uptake of autologous apoptotic cell differ from report of exclusive alternative pathway activation by the transformed cell line , jurkat t lymphocyte and a lung adenocarcinoma .",72,,,,these difference may be explain by the condition and / or reagent use .,73,,,,"for example , the use of serum with selective complement component deficiency reveal that complement activation by hemodialysis membrane , long think to be mediate exclusively by the alternative pathway , require initiation by the classical pathway .",74,,,,"also , in study by Nagasawa and colleague , apoptosis be induce by antibody ( anti-fas ) and a transformed macrophage like cell , thp-1 , use for phagocytosis .",75,,,,"during apoptosis , a key alteration to the cell surface membrane be the translocation of the negatively charge PS from the inside to the outside of the cell .",76,,,,"in addition , it be know that PS exposure on apoptotic cell be require for efficient uptake of apoptotic cell by phagocyte .",77,,,,"to determine whether PS exposure , complement activation , and phagocytic recognition of cell bind complement product could be sequential step in a physiological pathway for removal of apoptotic cell , we first examine the relationship between PS exposure on the cell membrane and complement activation .",78,,,,annexin v bind to PS on the cell surface in a ca2+ dependent manner .,79,,,,"therefore , we examine whether annexin v would compete for complement binding and activation .",80,,,,the ~ 40 % reduction in c3bus deposition on apoptotic cell preincubate with annexin v strongly suggest that exposure of PS either directly or indirectly activate complement .,81,,,,the detection of c3bus on almost all of the annexin Vhi express cell and the failure of annexin v to completely inhibit complement activation suggest that the binding site for complement and annexin v be overlap but not identical and and or that other molecule contribute to complement activation .,82,,,,negatively charge phospholipid such as cardiolipin have previously be show to activate c1 in the absence of antibody .,83,,,,"furthermore , clearance of PS contain liposome by the liver be complement dependent .",84,,,,these observation reinforce the finding that PS activate complement and be require for uptake by fix macrophage .,85,,,,"the reason why complement activation on apoptotic cell fail to cause lysis of the cell be uncertain but may be explain by modulation of complement regulatory molecule , binding of additional serum protein on the surface of apoptotic cell , alteration in the composition of the cell surface membrane , the rapid removal of opsonized cell , or a combination of these factor .",86,,,,complement activation and amplification via the alternative pathway loop rapidly lead to cleavage of c3 and covalent binding of c3b to the activate cell surface .,87,,,,"in the presence of serum , factor I proteolytically cleave c3b to c3bus .",88,,,,"whereas c3b have a half-life of only 90 s , the half-life of c3bus be ~ 35 min , account for its major role in opsonization ( - ) .",89,,,,"to compare the relative role of the macrophage complement receptor that recognize c3bus ( cr3 and cr4 ) with previously describe apoptotic cell receptor and ligand system , we analyze the effect of different inhibitory mab or peptide on the uptake of apoptotic cell by macrophage in the presence of serum .",90,,,,"for human peripheral blood derive macrophage , only blockade of cr3 or cr4 reduce the pi by > 50 % , whereas blockade of previously describe receptor or ligand have a modest effect ( < 20 % inhibition ) .",91,,,,the dominant role of the complement receptor cr3 and cr4 in the uptake of apoptotic cell in the presence of serum suggest that complement may play the most active role in removal of apoptotic cell in vivo ( see below ) .,92,,,,"in view of the cross-talk between integrin , it be possible that complement receptor engagement suppress or have a transdominant inhibitory effect on other integrin contain receptor .",93,,,,"the failure of previous study to demonstrate a role for complement receptor in the uptake of apoptotic cell in vitro be , most likely , explain by the omission of serum in these assay or aging of neutrophil in the presence of serum before the phagocytic assay in the absence of serum .",94,,,,"in the latter study , complement be likely to have be activate with the deposition of c3bus on the apoptotic neutrophil in the "" aging "" step and thereby may account for the lack of a requirement for serum in the phagocytosis assay .",95,,,,complement component may also have be secrete by the macrophage in the 4-h assay period .,96,,,,"when apoptotic cell be expose to serum but the phagocytosis step be perform in the absence of serum , we also observe that the pi be increase more than threefold .",97,,,,"the slightly lower pi in the two step assay compare with the one step assay could be explain by increase proteolysis of c3bus by serum factor such as factor i , or may indicate that other serum factor be require for optimal phagocytosis .",98,,,,cr3 and cr4 have interesting relationship with previously describe phagocytic receptor for apoptotic cell .,99,"human, macrophages","S2,C3",,the cd14 binding site for apoptotic cell and lp on human macrophage be identical or very close .,100,,E6,"S2,C3","since cr3 and cr4 also bind to lp and lps-binding protein , these receptor may have a similar hydrophobic lipid binding site or cd14 , a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) - link membrane protein , may associate with the exodomain of the complement receptor to promote phagocytosis and / or signal transduction after exposure to apoptotic cell .",101,"mammalian, Drosophila melanogaster","S3,S4",,"another recently describe protein propose to be involve in the engulfment of cell corpse be the c. elegan protein ced-5 ( the mammalian and drosophila melanogaster homologue be dock 180 and myoblast city , respectively [ 44 ] ) .",102,,E7,"S3,S4","interestingly , dock 180 interact with CRK , a protein that regulate integrin mediated ra signal transduction ( for a review , see reference ) .",103,,,,"take together with the result report here , these finding suggest a possible relationship between engagement of the two integrin and activation of apoptotic cell engulfment .",104,,,,the requirement for complement activation in the efficient uptake of autologous apoptotic cell appear contrary to the notion that phagocytosis of apoptotic cell be a noninflammatory process .,105,,,,"however , binding and phagocytosis via macrophage cr3 do not trigger leukotriene release or a respiratory burst .",106,"monocytes, human","E8,E9,C4,S5","C4,S5","furthermore , ligation of cr3 and other complement receptor may actually be immunosuppressive by downregulate il-12 and ifn-gamma production by human monocyte ( - ) .",107,,,,"therefore , it seem likely that the pro- or antiinflammatory consequence of complement activation on macrophage depend on the specific ligand encounter and receptor engage ( see below ) .",108,,,,"during the normal turnover of lymphocyte and myeloid cell , billion of apoptotic cell need to be eliminate daily within the circulation .",109,,,,the result of these study suggest a important homeostatic role for complement in the noninflammatory clearance of apoptotic cell .,110,,,,"since complement activation be require for efficient phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cell by macrophage as show here , deficiency in the early component of the complement pathway would be predict to result in impaired clearance of apoptotic cell .",111,,,,"we have recently show that exposure to excess number of apoptotic cell can induce autoantibody production and glomerular igg deposition in normal mouse , and Botto et al. .",112,,,,detect abnormal number of apoptotic cell in the kidney of mouse deficient in c1q that develop a lupus like disease .,113,,,,"take together , these finding provide a compelling role for complement in the clearance of apoptotic cell in vivo and could explain why human with early complement component deficiency develop sle .",114,,,,"in contrast to patient with defective expression of the common beta chain ( cd18 ) who develop recurrent bacterial infection , a patient with a selective deficiency of cd11b epitope 17 expression present with sle .",115,,,,"however , it be unlikely that lack of cd11b alone be sufficient to develop lupus , as cd11b deficient mouse be clinically well and we in vitro study indicate that both cr3 and cr4 be involve in uptake of apoptotic cell .",116,,,,"in addition , apoptotic cell death could also explain why complement be activate in diverse pathology such as myocardial infarction , burn , AIDS , and uv irradiation , where significant number of apoptotic cell be produce ( - ) .",117,,,,figure and table,118,,,,Figure 1,119,,,,"heat-labile serum factor ( s ) augment the phagocytosis of
