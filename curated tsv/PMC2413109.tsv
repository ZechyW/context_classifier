1						Organization of multiprotein complexes at cell-cell junctions
2	NA	"epithelial, endothelial cells"	"c1,c2"			The formation of stable cell-cell contacts is required for the generation of barrier forming sheets of epithelial and endothelial cells .
3						"During various physiological processes like tissue development , wound healing or tumorigenesis , cellular junctions are reorganized to allow the release or the incorporation of individual cells ."
4						Cell-cell contact formation is regulated by multiprotein complexes which are localized at specific structures along the lateral cell junctions like the tight junctions and adherens junctions and which are targeted to these site through their association with cell adhesion molecules .
5						Recent evidence indicates that several major protein complexes exist which have distinct functions during junction formation .
6						"However , this evidence also indicates that their composition is dynamic and subject to changes depending on the state of junction maturation ."
7						"Thus , cell-cell contact formation and integrity is regulated by a complex network of protein complexes ."
8						Imbalancing this network by oncogenic proteins or pathogens results in barrier breakdown and eventually in cancer .
9						"Here , I will review the molecular organization of the major multiprotein complexes at junctions of epithelial cells and discuss their function in cell-cell contact formation and maintenance ."
10						Introduction
11						"In multicellular organisms , cell-cell adhesion is involved in most developmental processes ."
12						"It is necessary for example for the assembly of coherent sheets of barrier forming epithelial and endothelial cells which line the inner and outer surfaces of the organism like those of the intestine , the skin or the blood vessels ."
13						"However , also in adult tissues cell-cell contacts are far from being static structures which maintain the barriers by simply holding cells together ."
14						"During the turnover of growing tissues such as the intestine or the skin , they are constantly remodeled to allow the extrusion of "" old "" cells and the incorporation of "" young "" cells derived from stem cells without a concomitant loss of the barrier function ( Fuchs et al. . )"
15						.
16						"Similarly , during leukocyte extravasation in secondary lymphoid organs or at sites of an ongoing immune response , the homotypic interactions between endothelial cells must be altered to allow the passage of the leukocytes without affecting the barrier properties of the endothelium ( Ley et al. . )"
17						.
18						"Finally , during wound healing and tissue repair , cells undergo a coordinated movement , proliferate and establish new cell-cell contacts once they encounter cells from the opposing site of the wound ( Perez-Moreno and Fuchs ) ."
19						These different demands in different cell types and different physiological situations require a sophisticated regulatory network which enables a partial dismantling and re-establishment of cell-cell contacts while simultaneously preventing the loss of an epithelial phenotype which in adult tissues frequently correlates with tumor progression and metastasis ( Thiery ) .
20						"Not surprisingly , the organization of cell-cell contacts of epithelial has attracted a great deal of attention ."
21						Due to the easy accessibility of cultured epithelial cells many discoveries have been made in epithelial cells .
22						"Epithelial cell-cell contacts contain three major adhesive structures which can be identified at the ultrastructural level , the tight junctions ( TJs ) , the adherens junctions ( AJs ) , and the desmosomes ."
23						"In polarized epithelial cells of certain tissues like the intestine , TJs and AJs are asymmetrically distributed at the apical region of the lateral cell contact forming the apical junctional complex ( AJC ) which encircles the apex of the cells and demarkates the border between the apical and the basolateral membrane domains ( Nelson ) ."
24						"Common to all three types of structures is the presence of several adhesion molecules that link the neighbouring cells through homophilic and heterophilic adhesive interactions , and the presence of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins that organize signaling complexes and which provide a mechanical link to the actin cytoskeleton ( or intermediate filaments in the case of desmosomes ) ."
25						The scaffolding proteins might also link different protein complexes -- at least temporarily -- and thus organize supramolecular protein complexes .
26						"It should be noted that these protein complexes are dynamic , and that their composition is subject to regulation depending on junctional maturation and integrity ."
27						"During the last few years , a rapid progress has been made in identifying new proteins at cell-cell contacts and in particular in deciphering the molecular composition of the TJs ."
28						Among the most exciting findings was probably the discovery of protein complexes at TJs which are highly conserved through evolution and which regulate cellular polarization in different organisms and various cell types .
29						"Here , I will review the major multiprotein complexes present at cell-cell contacts of vertebrate epithelial cells and highlight the most recent advances in the understanding of their role in the organization and functions of epithelial cell-cell contacts in vertebrates ."
30						Adherens junctions
31						The function of adherens junctions
32						A main function of AJs is to connect cells to regulate tissue formation and morphogenesis during development as well as the maintenance of solid tissues in the adult organism ( Gumbiner ) .
33						"The major cell adhesion molecules at AJs , the classical cadherins , connect adjacent cells through homophilic interactions and are linked to the cytoskeleton through proteins associated with their cytoplasmic tail , the catenins ."
34			e1	"c1,c2"	cadherin-catenin complexes 	This link generates a transcellular network of actin filaments running through the entire sheet of cells with the cadherin-catenin complexes serving as connectors of the actin filaments bundles at the intercellular space .
35						"During morphogenetic events , for example during neural tube formation , mechanical forces can thus be applied to the whole cellular sheet ."
36						"In adult tissues , cadherin mediated cell adhesion is absolutely required for cell-cell adhesion to be maintained as a loss of cadherin adhesion by Ca 2+ -depletion results in a loss of cell-cell interaction and rounding up of the cells despite a number of other adhesion molecules ( which are not Ca 2+ -dependent ) at cell-cell contacts ( Takeichi ) ."
37						Cadherins and catenins
38						Fig. 1
39						Major protein complexes at adherens junctions .
40						Two major protein complexes exist at AJs of epithelial cells .
41						The cadherin and catenin complex consist of the Ca 2+ -dependent adhesion molecule E-cadherin and the armadillo repeat proteins p120 ctn and beta and gamma-catenin which directly bind to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin .
42						alpha-catenin directly associates with beta-catenin but not simultaneously with F-actin .
43						The nectin and afadin complex consists of the Ca 2+ -independent adhesion molecule nectin and the PDZ protein afadin .
44						Afadin contains a F-actin-binding domain and thus can link the nectin-afadin system to the actin cytoskeleton .
45						The two adhesion complexes can be linked through several molecular interactions .
46						Afadin can directly interact with alpha-catenin .
47						"It also interacts with ponsin and SH3P12 which can interact with the F-actin-binding protein vinculin , and it interacts with LMO7 and ADIP which both can interact with the F-actin binding protein alpha-actinin ."
48						The nature of the link between the cadherin and catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton is still unclear .

125						Tight junctions
126						The function of TJs
127						Fig. 2
128						Integral membrane proteins at tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial can be grouped into three classes based on their overall organizations .
129						"The first class is characterized by two extracellular loops , four transmembrane regions , and two cytoplasmic tails ( occludin , claudins , tricellulin ) ."
130						The second class consists of Ig-SF members which all contain two Ig like domains .
131						"The third class ( contains only one member , CRB3 ) is characterized by a short extracellular domain ( 36 AA ) , a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail ."
132						"In contrast to the other integral membrane proteins , the function of the extracellular domain of CRB3 is not clear"
133						"In polarized epithelial cells , the TJs forms a belt like structure at the apical region of the cellular junction and represent a boundary between the apical and the basolateral membrane domains which differ in the composition of lipids and proteins ( Tsukita et al. . )"
134						.
135						"At the TJ area , two structures can be distinguished by ultrathin electron microscopy : sites where the intercellular space is basically obliterated and where the outer leaflets of the adjacent membranes appear to be in direct contact , and regions where the membranes of the two adjacent cells are separated by intercellular space ."
136						"By freeze-fracture electron microscopy , the TJ area appears as a branched network of strands where the strands reflect the sites of direct membrane contacts ( Tsukita et al. . )"
137						.
138						"Two major functions are attributed to TJs : First , the regulation of the paracellular permeability of the epithelial sheet for ions and small solutes , which is an organ specific function and which varies for different epithelia depending on the specific requirements of the organ ( Furuse and Tsukitas ; Van Itallie and Anderson ) ; second , the formation of a physical barrier to prevent intramembrane diffusion of lipids and proteins , a rather cell-autonomous function which is necessary for a cell to maintain an asymmetric distribution of membrane components and to develop membrane polarity ( Tsukita et al. . )"
139						.
140						"In the recent years it has become clear that the molecular basis of the TJ strands are claudins , a family of integral membrane proteins at TJs which are constituents of the TJ strands and which induce the formation of TJ strands upon ectopic expression in fibroblasts ( Furuse et al. . )"
141						.
142						"Claudins do not just create TJ strands , but within the strands form a selective permeability barrier by forming size- and charge selective aqueous pores ( Tsukita and Furuse ; Van Itallie and Anderson ) ."
143						"Surprisingly , the TJ strands do not seem to be the basis for the second major function of TJs , the diffusion barrier for intramembrane particles ( Umeda et al. . )"
144						.
145						It has also become clear that the TJs harbor peripheral membrane proteins which regulate cell polarity and membrane asymmetry suggesting that these proteins are involved in the role of TJs in regulating apico-basal polarity .

150						"Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs , a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs ."
151						"These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1 , adaptor proteins , transcription regulators and RNA processing factors , regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins , kinases and phosphatases , and heat shock proteins ."
152						Double arrows indicate direct interactions .
153						Not all direct interactions that have been identified are depicted
154						Three different classes of integral membrane proteins have been identified at TJs .
155						"One class comprises occludin , claudins and tricellulin , which all contain four transmembrane domains , two extracellular loops , and the N-terminal and C-terminal ends are localized in the cytoplasm ."
156						Twenty-four claudins have been identified in humans .
157						The major role of claudins is to form paired strands through homophilic and heterophilic cis and trans interactions .
158						"The large number of claudins , their ability to undergo heterophilic interactions and their ion selectivity allows for the formation of TJ strands with specific permeability properties depending on the needs of a specific tissue ( Furuse and Tsukita ) ."
159						Occludin is incorporated into TJ strands but its ectopic expression does not induce strand formation ( Furuse et al. . )
160						suggesting that it has rather an accessory role in TJ strand formation ( Yu et al. . )
161						.
162						Tricellulin differs from claudins and occludin in its specific enrichment at tricellular contact sites ( Ikenouchi et al. . )
163						.
164						The second class of integral membrane proteins comprises members of the CTX subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily which is characterized by one V-type and one C2-type Ig like domain ( Williams and Barclay ) .
165						"Based on sequence homology , the length of their cytoplasmic tails and the type of the C-terminal PDZ domain motifs , the Ig-SF proteins at TJs can be further subdivided into a group consisting of JAM-A , JAM-B and JAM-C , and in a second group consisting of CAR , CLMP , ESAM , and JAM4 ( Ebnet et al. . )"

548						Conclusions and perspectives
549	NA	 epithelial cells	c16			The last decade has witnessed a steady increase in the number of new proteins localized at cell-cell contacts of epithelial cells .
550						The identification of claudins at TJs has strongly increased the understanding of the molecular basis of TJ function .
551			"e190,e191"	c16	 PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex and the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex	The identification of cell polarity protein complexes like the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex and the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex at TJs has added new aspects on the mechanisms underlying the development of TJs .
552						The identification of the nectin-afadin system provided evidence for a second major adhesive system besides the cadherin-catenin system at AJs .
553						It also became evident that TJs and AJs are signaling centers which are actively engaged in regulating proliferation and differentiation through feed-back mechanisms with the cytoskeleton and the nucleus .

565						"In the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , a large number of proteins typically associated with TJs or AJs was found to mediate autotypic Schwann cell interactions within the myelin sheath as well as heterotypic Schwann cell-axon interactions ."
566						"For example , different claudins , JAM-C , Necl-1 , Necl-2 , Necl-4 , and various scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 , PATJ , ZO-1 , ZO-2 , PAR-3 and MAGI-2 are localized at areas of non compact myelin including Schmidt-Lanterman-incisures , paranodal loops , and mesaxons , and some proteins preferentially localize to some but not other areas ( Maurel et al. ."
567						; Poliak et al. .
568						; Spiegel et al. . )

570						The absence of claudin-19 or JAM-C in mice results in defective nerve conduction indicating that both are critically important for the proper functioning of the PNS ( Miyamoto et al. .
571						; Scheiermann et al. . )
572						.
573						Necl-1 and Necl-4 mediate heterotypic interactions between axons and Schwann cells during myelination ( Maurel et al. .

575						.
576						And PAR-3 has recently been identified at the interface between pre-myelinating Schwann cells and axons along the internodal region ( Chan et al. . )
577						.
578						"PAR-3 is expressed by the Schwann cells , not by the axon , and recruits the p75 neurotrophin receptor to the glial-axon junction to regulate myelination of the axon ."

585						"Nevertheless , the use of a set of conserved proteins by morphologically diverse cell types to regulate cell-cell contact formation highlights both the importance of the proteins for cellular function as well as their versatility that allows the regulation of similar aspects in different cell types ."
586						Many open questions remain .
587						"For example , what is the molecular nature of the intramembrane diffusion barrier ( fence function ) of the TJs ?"
588						"The absence of TJ strands in cells lacking all three ZO proteins results in a complete loss of the barrier function of the epithelial sheet but , unexpectedly , the fence function which has been attributed to the presence of TJ strands is retained ( Umeda et al. . )"
589						.
590						"Membrane diffusion barriers exist also in other cells even in the absence of a physical cell-cell contact , for example at the axonal hillock of neurons to separate somatodendritic and axonal membrane domains ( Winckler et al. . )"
591						.
592						It has been suggested that in these cells the accumulation of integral membrane proteins that are anchored to the submembranous cytoskeleton function as rows of pickets which prevent the free diffusion of even small molecules ( Nakada et al. . )
593						.
594			e198	c16	 PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex	A second unresolved issue is if the activity of the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex to regulate membrane asymmetry is mechanistically linked to its role in TJ formation .
595						"Finally , the functional interrelationship of the three major polarity complexes at TJs ( depicted in Figs , ) has not been resolved , yet ."
596						Members of individual complexes interact with each other .
597						"For example , CRB3 can also interact with PAR-6 ( Lemmers et al. . )"
598						", PAR-6 can also interact with Pals1 ( Hurd et al. . )"
599						", and ZO-3 can interact with PATJ ( Roh et al. . )"
600						.
601						Genetic evidence in Drosophila suggests a functional hierarchy among the protein complexes ( Johnson and Wodarz ) but it is unclear if a similar hierarchy exists in vertebrate epithelial cells and which aspects of cell-cell contact formation are regulated by these interactions .
602						"Most likely , many of these interactions are dynamically regulated and occur in a temporally and spatially restricted manner ."
603						"The large number of scaffolding and signaling molecules identified at cell-cell contacts and the multitude of physical interactions described so far among these proteins indicates that cell-cell contact formation , the development of TJs from pAJs and the aquisition of membrane polarity is a highly dynamic process the complexity of which is still far from being completely understood ."
